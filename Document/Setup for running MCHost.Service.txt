MCHost.Service can be placed anywhere in it's own directory,
but it requires an environment variable that defines the location of the root "minecraft" folder that contains the mc packages and instances.

Search "System" in start, go to "Advanced system settings" and on the Advanced tab, click on Environment Variables.
Under User Variables, click on New...

Variable name: MCHOST_MINECRAFT
Value should be the direct (full) path to the "minecraft" folder, such as in my case:

D:\Coding\Public Projects\MCHost\minecraft

where the following subfolder paths would be valid:
D:\Coding\Public Projects\MCHost\minecraft\packages
D:\Coding\Public Projects\MCHost\minecraft\instances
and so forth.

The MCHost.Service will warn you in case this configuration is not properly setup.
